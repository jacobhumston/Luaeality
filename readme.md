# Luaeality
Discord bot written in Lua using Luvit and Discordia!

# Setup
Clone or download `https://github.com/jacobhumston/Luaeality.git`.

Then in the same directory, you'll want to create a file named `token.lua`. With the following contents:

```lua
return {
    Token = "bot-token-here"
}
```
Then run `luvit main.lua` and youre good to go!
